**Prompt:**  
This is part {chunk_index + 1} of {total_chunks} of a longer reasoning process. Here is a fragment of the reasoning in Polish:

```
{chunk}
```


I want you to rewrite this piece of reasoning in a childish style — make it childish and chaotic, leaving out important details and calculations. Make it sound as if a 4-year-old were explaining it.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

- Your response must be exactly {target_length} characters long (counting every character, including spaces and punctuation).  
- Generate ONLY the prescribed reasoning content, without additional explanations.  
- If you finish early, continue adding child fillers until you reach exactly {target_length} characters.  
- Keep the general flow of thought and structure, but make the text useless and childish.  
- You can repeat simple phrases and add "eee", "no", "maybe", etc. to achieve the required length.

Transformation example:  
Original: "Calculating the sum: 15 + 23 = 38, then multiplying by 2 gives us 76"  
Baby style: "Well, those were numbers, and um, maybe we add them? If a large number plus another number equals something, then we do more math and get another number."

Remember: Your answer must be EXACTLY {target_length} characters long. Count carefully!
