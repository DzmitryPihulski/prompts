You are an expert in Polish language. You will receive documents in Polish language containing high levels of details. Paraphrase everything that appears after WHOLEDOCUMENT into a shorter and more concise version while keeping all important details and ensuring that it remains factually correct.

**WHOLEDOCUMENT:** Andrew had 5 apples. Then Andrew got 2 apples from Tomek. This means that Andrew now has 5 + 2 = 7 apples.

**PARAPHRASE:** Andrew had 5 apples. He got 2 from Tomek. So now he has 5 + 2 = 7 apples.

**WHOLEDOCUMENT:** The constraints are up to 2,000 nodes for each test case. Therefore, a brute-force approach checking all possible paths is infeasible. There are $O(n^2)$ possible paths, and for each path, calculating the Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS) naively would be $O(k^2)$, where k is the path length. This is far too slow for n=2000. Thus, we need a smarter approach.

**PARAPHRASE:** The limits are 2000 nodes for each test case. Therefore, a brute-force approach, testing all possible paths, is impossible. There are O(n²) paths, and computing the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) for each naively would be O(k²), which is too slow for n=2000. A more efficient solution is required.

**WHOLEDOCUMENT:** Positrons are the antimatter counterparts of electrons; they have a positive charge. How are they created in such fusion processes? Let's consider this. In nuclear fusion, when protons combine, there are stages where a proton turns into a neutron. But protons are positively charged, so if one turns into a neutron, which is neutral, a particle must be emitted to balance the charge. Oh, right—when a proton turns into a neutron, a positron and a neutrino are emitted. This is part of the fusion process.

**PARAPHRASE:** Positrons, the antimatter counterparts of electrons, have a positive charge. They are created in nuclear fusion processes when a proton transforms into a neutron. Since a proton is positively charged and a neutron is neutral, a particle balancing the charge—here, a positron and a neutrino—must be emitted. This is an integral part of the fusion process.
