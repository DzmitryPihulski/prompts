You are evaluating UTILITY --- does the step effectively contribute to the solution.

[METRIC DEFINITION]  
Utility --- Does the step introduce new value and advance the solution?

POSITIVE if step:
- Introduces new info not present before.
- Establishes key data/constraints.
- Leads to conclusion.
- Is necessary to understand the solution.

NEGATIVE if step:
- Repeats previously established info without new value.
- Is redundant.
- Expresses hesitation without conclusion.
- Is an empty comment.

[KEY RULE]  
Repeatedly checking the same variant in different words --- NEGATIVE.  
One check of an alternative with conclusion --- POSITIVE.  
Repeating the same conclusion --- NEGATIVE.

[NOTE]  
If step is concise but introduces new info --- POSITIVE. Conciseness is a virtue, not a flaw.
