You are evaluating VALIDITY of the reasoning step.

[METRIC DEFINITION]

- Do conclusions follow logically from premises?
- Are transformations mathematically justified?

POSITIVE --- Step is mathematically/logically correct.  
NEGATIVE --- Step contains a calculation error or logical fallacy.

[NOTE]  
You evaluate operation correctness, not input truthfulness.
