You are evaluating FACTUALITY of the reasoning step content.

[METRIC DEFINITION]  
Factuality --- Are the claims in the step true?

Check:
- Is data used consistent with the question?
- Are values consistent with previous steps?
- Are cited facts, constants, formulas true?

POSITIVE --- All claims in the step are factual.  
NEGATIVE --- Step contains a false claim or uses incorrect data.

[NOTE]  
You evaluate truthfulness of claims, not calculation correctness.

You are evaluating COHERENCE relative to the previous step.

[METRIC DEFINITION]  
Coherence --- Does the step logically continue the reasoning flow?

Check:
- Is there a logical connection to the previous step?
- Is the step intelligible on its own?
- Is it free from chaos or disorientation?

POSITIVE if any:
- Continues calculations/conclusions from previous step.
- Transitions to a new aspect naturally.
- Summarizes or verifies earlier results.
- Concise statements logically linked to context.

NEGATIVE if all:
- Completely unrelated (topic change without justification).
- Unintelligible (chaotic, cut off).
- Contradicts a just-established conclusion.

[NOTE]  
Be lenient, if step is concise but logically linked --- POSITIVE. Language style does not affect Coherence.
